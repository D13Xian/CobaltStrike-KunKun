# ExternalC2
> A library for integrating communication channels with the Cobalt Strike External C2 server

This library provides an implementation of the [Cobalt Strike External C2 spec](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-externalc2), 
including a basic web channel and a websocket channel. The codebase has been documented and designed to allow additional channels to be
added easily.

This readme is not done yet, because coding is more enjoyable than writing documentation. However, the code is heavily commented and 
you should be reading that first, right? I recommend building the solution and stepping through the tests.

## Features

Implemented C2 Channels:
* Direct Socket Connection
* Web API Channel (Dotnet Core)
* WebSockets Channel (Dotnet Core)
